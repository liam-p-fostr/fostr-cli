# @fostr/cli

A command line utility for all things Fostr.

## Requirements

This tool is built to work with, and only supports, Node 16+. If you have problems running the CLI you should install the latest [Node](https://nodejs.org/) LTS version globally.

You can use a tool such as [Volta](https://volta.sh) for projects that need versions of Node that are different to your globally installed version.

## Installation

Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm i -g @fostr/cli
```

You can test installation was successful by running the following in your terminal to output the current Fostr CLI version:

```bash
fostr version
```
## Commands

All commands are ran as `fostr <command>` e.g. `fostr ping`. A list of available commands and what each command does is below:

| Command | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| ping | Responds with a `PONG!` to confirm CLI is responsive |
| version | Outputs the current Fostr CLI version |
